OpenClaw's Weixin channel plugin. Connect an OpenClaw Gateway to Weixin with QR-code login and receive and send messages through the Weixin backend.

## Highlights

- QR-code login with automatic credential storage.
- Multiple Weixin accounts on one OpenClaw Gateway.
- Text, image, voice, file, and video messages.
- Long-poll message delivery and typing indicators.
- OpenClaw channel routing, pairing, and session isolation.

## Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Node.js | `>=22.13.0` |
| OpenClaw runtime check | `>=2026.3.22` |
| npm peer dependency | `>=2026.5.12` |

Use OpenClaw `>=2026.5.12` when possible. The runtime guard currently accepts `>=2026.3.22`; npm installations using strict peer-dependency validation require the peer-dependency version.

OpenClaw must be installed and the `openclaw` CLI must be available. See the [OpenClaw installation guide](https://docs.openclaw.ai/install).

```bash
openclaw --version
```

## Quick start

### 1. Install the plugin

```bash
npx -y @tencent-weixin/openclaw-weixin-cli install
```

If the installer is not suitable for your environment, install the plugin directly:

```bash
openclaw plugins install "@tencent-weixin/openclaw-weixin"
```

### 2. Enable the plugin

```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.openclaw-weixin.enabled true
```

### 3. Log in with Weixin

```bash
openclaw channels login --channel openclaw-weixin
```

Scan the QR code with Weixin and confirm the authorization. Credentials are stored locally after a successful login.

### 4. Restart and verify the Gateway

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
openclaw channels status
```

## Configuration

### Multiple accounts

Run the login command again for each account:

```bash
openclaw channels login --channel openclaw-weixin
```

When multiple accounts are logged in, isolate direct-message sessions by account, channel, and peer:

```bash
openclaw config set session.dmScope per-account-channel-peer
```

### Custom BotAgent

Set an optional identifier for backend log attribution and monitoring:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "openclaw-weixin": {
      "botAgent": "MyBot/1.2.0"
    }
  }
}
```

`botAgent` is used for observability only. It is not an authentication credential and does not control message routing.

**Format** (UA-style):

- One or more `Name/Version` tokens, space-separated
- Each token may optionally be followed by ` (comment)`
- ASCII only; total length ≤ 256 bytes
- Invalid tokens are silently dropped during sanitization; falls back to
  `OpenClaw` if nothing valid remains

Examples that pass through unchanged:

- `MyBot/1.2.0`
- `MyBot/1.2.0 (region=cn;env=prod)`
- `MyBot/1.2.0 LangChain/0.3.5`
- `MyBot/1.2.0-rc.1+build.5`

**Note**: `bot_agent` is for observability only — it is not used for
authentication or routing. All registered agents on this plugin instance
currently share the same `botAgent` declaration; per-agent overrides may be
added in a future version if needed.

## Local quote cache

Newer WeChat clients may send only a server message ID for a quoted message. The plugin
stores the required text and media metadata locally so later quotes can restore their
context. The cache is enabled by default and failures do not interrupt normal message
delivery.

Configure it under `channels.openclaw-weixin.quoteCache` when you need different
retention or size limits. The default limits are 30 days and 10,000 text records per
account, plus 7 days, 256 MiB per account, and 25 MiB per media file. See the
[local quote cache guide](./docs/quote-cache_zh_CN.md) for the complete configuration,
storage behavior, and validation details.

## Uninstall

```bash
openclaw plugins uninstall @tencent-weixin/openclaw-weixin
```

## Troubleshooting

### The plugin reports an unsupported OpenClaw version

Check the host version:

```bash
openclaw --version
```

Upgrade OpenClaw to a supported version, then restart the Gateway.

### The channel shows `OK` but does not connect

Make sure the plugin is enabled and restart the Gateway:

```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.openclaw-weixin.enabled true
openclaw gateway restart
```

If the problem persists, inspect the Gateway log and verify that the account has completed QR-code login.

The backend protocol document is intended for developers implementing or integrating a compatible backend. It is not required for normal plugin installation.

## Development

This repository uses npm and requires Node.js `>=22.13.0`.

```bash
npm ci --ignore-scripts --include=dev
npm run ci
```

Run coverage separately when changing behavior or tests:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

Pull requests run the same quality, unit-test, coverage, build, and package smoke checks in GitHub Actions. See the [CI guide](./docs/ci.md) for details.

See the [development guide](./docs/development.md) for the complete worktree, dependency, packaging, and local installation workflow.

## Contributing

Bug reports, documentation improvements, tests, and code contributions are welcome. Please keep pull requests focused and include validation details. For changes to the backend integration, update the [protocol documentation](./docs/protocol.md) together with the implementation.
